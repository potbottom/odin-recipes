    <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Uzbek plov is considered the national dish of Uzbekistan and holds deep cultural significance throughout Central Asia. This rice dish has ancient roots tracing back over 1,000 years, evolving along the Silk Road trade routes where Persian, Arab, and local influences merged. Each region of Uzbekistan has developed its own variation, with Tashkent, Fergana, and Samarkand styles being the most renowned.</p>
        <p>Traditionally prepared by men in large cast-iron pots called "kazan," plov is more than just a mealâ€”it's a social ritual. The dish is central to celebrations, weddings, and religious festivals, symbolizing abundance and community. The cooking process itself is considered an art form, passed down through generations of male cooks who guard their family recipes closely.</p>
