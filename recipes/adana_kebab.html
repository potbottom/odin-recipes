    <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Adana Kebab originates from the city of Adana in southern Turkey and is named after this vibrant Mediterranean city. The dish emerged in the early 20th century, created by local chefs who perfected the art of grilling spiced ground meat on wide, flat skewers. The recipe was influenced by the region's abundant red peppers and the culinary traditions of the diverse communities living in this ancient crossroads city.</p>
        <p>The kebab gained national recognition when it spread from Adana's local restaurants to become one of Turkey's most beloved dishes. Its distinctive feature is the use of tail fat mixed with the meat and the signature Adana pepper, which gives the kebab its characteristic red color and moderate heat. Today, it's considered one of the essential Turkish kebabs and has strict preparation standards recognized by the Turkish Patent Institute.</p>
