    <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Hunkar Begendi, meaning "Sultan's Delight," is a legendary Ottoman dish 
        that dates back to the 19th century. According to popular legend, this 
        creamy eggplant puree was created to impress Empress Eugénie of France 
        during her visit to Sultan Abdülaziz in 1869. The dish was supposedly so 
        delicious that the Empress requested the recipe from the palace chefs.</p>
        <p>This elegant dish represents the sophisticated cuisine of the Ottoman palace 
        kitchens, where French culinary influences merged with traditional Turkish 
        flavors. The combination of silky eggplant puree topped with tender lamb 
        stew became a symbol of imperial hospitality and culinary excellence.</p>
